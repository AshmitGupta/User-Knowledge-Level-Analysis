# User-Knowledge-Level-Analysis
Knowing how to study effectively and efficiently is the key to success for many university students. Therefore, our initial research question was: Given degree of study time for goal object materials (STG), degree of repetition (SCG), degree of study time of user for related objects (STR), exam performance of user for related objects (LPR), and exam performance of user for goal objects (PEG),  what would be the overall knowledge level of the user (UNS)? However, after further analysis (which will be explained below), we have altered our research question: Given exam performance of users for related objects (LPR), and exam performance of users for goal objects (PEG),  what would be the overall knowledge level of the user (UNS)? The dataset that we will be using to answer this question is called User Knowledge (retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/User+Knowledge+Modeling). The User Knowledge Modeling Data Set classifies the overall knowledge level of a user into 4 categories: Very Low, Low, Middle, High.
